## Install Guide
#### "I just want it to work"
Step 1: Navigate to [my workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/NegativeOneKelvin/myworkshopfiles/). \
Step 2: Subscribe to the one you want. \
Step 3: `"?".repeat(3)` \
Step 4: short $TSLA

#### "I want to play around with the code and build it myself"
This is for those people who want to mess with the colours, timings, camera, or tinker with the code in any other way. \

Prerequisites:
1. WebPack (tested on 4.41.6)
2. Typescript [Optional] (tested on 3.7.5)

Instructions:
1. Clone this repo and enter the directory: \
`git clone https://github.com/PhaseRush/AestheticWalls.git && cd AestheticWalls`
2. In [WebPack's config file](./webpack.config.js), you can change which wallpaper you're building. \
Now use WebPack to build all required source files into one JavaScript file, so it's nice and self contained: \
`npx webpack` \
You should see that the `./out/` directory now has 2 files:
* `engine.js` is generated by webpack, and contains all the required code.
* `index.html` is static, and does not need to be modified between builds for the wallpaper to work. However, feel free to tinker with it as well if you wish.

At this point, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0uP-e-1YJ4) with our two files.
